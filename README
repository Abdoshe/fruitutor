Fruitutor
---------
A typing tutor to help learn to use the Twiddler V3 one-handed chorded
keyboard.

Become fluent with the Twiddler so you can keep one hand on the keyboard
and one hand on the mouse at all times, living Engelbart's dream.

The point is to run on Android so you can train on the train.  Currently
waiting for the Kivy project to release Python 3 for Android support.
Fruitutor won't run on Android until then.


Requires Python 3 and Kivy.

NOT ready for use at this point in time.


To test: ./run_debug.sh
