Fruitutor
---------
A typing tutor to help learn to use the Twiddler V3 one-handed chorded
keyboard.  Licensed under the GPL V3.

SEE IT IN ACTION HERE: http://ontbee.com/img/fruitutor_demo.gif

Note the key combo for the next character is highlighted in yellow on
the left--that's the whole point of this program.

Become fluent with the Twiddler so you can keep one hand on the keyboard
and one hand on the mouse at all times, living Engelbart's dream.

The idea is to run on Android so you can train on the train.  Currently
waiting for the Kivy project to release Python 3 for Android support.
Fruitutor won't run on Android until then.


Requires Python 3 and Kivy.

NOT ready for use at this point in time.


To test: ./run_debug.sh

Note that once you finish the last lesson, nothing will happen on
enter.  Obviously this'll be changed in later versions.

Also statistics aren't implemented yet, they'll just say 0.0.
