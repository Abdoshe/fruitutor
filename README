Fruitutor
---------
A typing tutor to help learn to use the Twiddler V3 one-handed chorded
keyboard.  Licensed under the GPL V3.

NOT ready for use at this point in time.

Note the key combo for the next character is highlighted in yellow on
the left--that's the whole point of this program.


Become fluent with the Twiddler so you can keep one hand on the keyboard
and one hand on the mouse at all times, living Engelbart's dream.

The idea is to run on Android so you can train on the train.  Currently
waiting for the Kivy project to release Python 3 for Android support.
Fruitutor won't run on Android until then.


Setup
-----
Requires Python 3 and Kivy.

Set up a virtualenv and install everything in requirements.txt.

Kivy installation in Python 3 is a pain, you'll probably have to
search pip install errors to find which packages your OS needs to
compile Kivy.  Final release will have full instructions for Ubuntu
and Debian.


Use
---
To test: ./run_debug.sh

Note that once you finish the last lesson, nothing will happen on
pressing enter.  Obviously this'll be changed in later versions.

Also statistics aren't implemented yet, they all just say 0.0.
